# Women in Coding History (WICH)

This site is an educational resource that includes a timeline showing how women have in fact shaped the field of coding since its inception, from before the first computer was even invented. It will eventually include current and future
projects being headed by female coders, and a page with links to resources for women and girls who want to learn more about coding and the tech industry. 

The project is a work in progress, with more historical and current figures who will be included on the illustrated timeline. It is aimed at both school children and adults who do not necessarily know much about programming, tech, or the history behind its development. Any technical terms used are therefore explained in simple and accessible language. 

The aim of this project is to educate and engage women and girls who would not "normally" be interested in this subject or who are new to it. The colour palette and imagery is therefore gentle, non-glaring, friendly, and "soft". It is meant to be inviting to those who might otherwise feel intimidated or nervous about discussions concerning technology. 

Ultimately, the aim is for this site to contribute towards more gender equality in the field of software engineering and to raise awareness of the great accomplishments that have already been achieved by female coders. The knowledge of positive role models, past and present, can inspire women and girls to see themselves and their potential aptitudes in a new and more confident way.
