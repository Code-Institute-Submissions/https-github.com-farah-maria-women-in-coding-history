# **Women in Coding History (WICH)**

Did you know that women have been writing machine-readable code since the 1840s? And that coding used to be considered "women's work"? Yet according to a Statista poll taken in 2021, only 5% of software developers worldwide are female.

This site is both a general interest and educational resource that shows how women have in fact shaped the world of coding since its inception, from before the first computing device was even invented. The website includes an illustrated timeline. This will eventually include current and future projects being headed by female coders, not just historical figures. I also hope to add a page with links to resources for women and girls who want to learn more about coding and the tech industry. 

The project is a work in progress, with more figures who need including on the timeline. It is aimed at both school children and adults who do not necessarily know much about programming, tech, or the history behind its development. Any technical terms used are therefore explained in simple and accessible language. 

The aim is to educate and engage women and girls who would not "normally" be interested in this subject or who are new to it. The colour palette and imagery is therefore gentle, non-glaring, friendly, and "soft". The site is meant to be inviting to those who might otherwise feel intimidated by tech talk. 

Ultimately, the greater aim is to contribute towards gender equality in the field of software engineering and to raise awareness of the great accomplishments already been achieved by female coders. The knowledge of positive role models, past and present, will hopefully inspire women and girls to feel "I could do this, too!"
