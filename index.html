        Did you know that women have been writing computer code since the 1840s? And that coding used to be considered a job only fit for women? However, according to a Statista poll taken in 2021 (according to Statista.Com athttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1126823/worldwide-developer-gender/ ), only 5% of software developers worldwide are now female, with 92% of coders identifying as male, 1% identifying as non-binary and 3% prefering not to say/ "other".* This site is an attempt to show how women have in fact shaped this field of work, before the first computer was even invented. It has been done before, and it can be that way again. This site includes current and future projects that are being headed by women coders.
