    <section id="center-text"><strong>Did you know that women have been writing machine-readable code since the 1840s? And that coding used to be considered "women's work"? According to a Statista poll taken in 2021, now only 5% of software developers worldwide are female, with 92% identifying as male and 1% as non-binary.*<br><br>This site exists to show how women have in fact shaped this field of work, from before the first computer was even invented. The timeline on this site includes current and future projects being headed by female coders, and a page will soon be added that includes resources for women and girls who want to learn more about coding and the tech industry.</strong></section>
