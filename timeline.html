              a hypothetical 'Analytical Engine' could be programmed before the first computer was even invented.

                The coders for the pioneering ENIAC project in the USA were an all female team consisting of Kathleen MacNulty, 
                Jean Jennings, Betty Snyder, Mary Wescoff, Frances Bilas and Ruth Lichterman. They established core software principles 
                used today, such as using break points (- pausing a program at various points while it's running -) to help debug (or "fix") 
                faulty computer programming. The modern computer as we know it had not yet been invented, so the ENIAC computer 
                was an odd looking object. It was as big as a room, with wires and flashing buttons. However, it was able to direct a missile!

                <p>
                Rhodes developed and programmed some of the earliest computers. She was a Ukrainian Jewish female mathematician at a time when 
                this was not very common. Rhodes co-designed a computer programming language called C-10. It was for a computer called the UNIVAC I, 
                which was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer made for businesses in the USA.

                Johnson was an Afro-American maths genius and "human computer" whose calculations put the first ever American astronaut in space. 
                She worked for NASA and NACA (the organisation that was the predecessor for NASA) for 33 years and helped pioneer the use of 
                machine computers to perform the task of calculating complex trajectories (flight paths) in space. She worked for NASA's 
                Project Apollo and Project Mercury. For Project Mercury, she verified the first calculations of an actual electronic computer.

                class="float-left">
                Hopper worked on the world's first programmable computer, the Harvard Mark 1, and was the first to devise machine-independent
                programming. Previously, any given coding language only worked on one device... There was no language that could be used 
                across different computing machines. So, Hopper made the first portable software coding language when she invented FLOWMATIC, 
                which evolved into COBOL, which is still used today.<br><p>Hopper also invented the first computer <strong>compiler</strong> 
                as part of her work, which is a code translater that translates a programming language into machine code. 
                Machine code is something that can be 'read' by a computer, and is always binary, which means it is made-up entirely of zeros 
                and ones.  It is necessary to perform this step to make any coding program do-able, because computers only "understand" binary
                language. Everything we do on a computer is turned into binary for it to be processed, and then turned back into language 
                we understand after the computer has done what we've asked. A short video about Hopper's life can be found

                So, now you know what a compiler is! Allen was a pioneer in optimising compilers. She made the long process of 
                converting software programs into zeroes and ones a lot faster and easier. This work helped established the foundations 
                of modern computing as we know it. She worked for IBM from 1957 to 2002 and was the first woman to win the Turing Award 
                in 2006.

                Hamilton was a computer scientist who led the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which in 1961 
                worked with NASA to develop the Apollo program’s guidance system. Without this, the spacecraft would not have travelled in the correct 
                direction. The Apollo project took the first astronaut to the moon. Margaret Hamilton was the first person who used the words “software engineering”
                to describe her line of work.

                  The code of Valerie Thomas allowed NASA to observe the Earth from space for the first time. 
                  Her Illusion Transmitter, patented in 1980, meant that images could be transmitted across long distances 
                  using dome-shaped mirrors. Thomas worked for the Landsat program and wrote the code that took in data from 
                  a Landsat CCT (computer compatible tape) and printed it out in a form that was easy for scientists to read. 
                  She learned and used the coding language FORTRAN for her work. Valerie Thomas is now a mentor for students 
                  through the organisation S.M.A.R.T and she works to encourage the participation of women of colour in science

                  Radia Perlman  is most famous for her invention of the spanning-tree protocol (STP). This is not an easy 
                  concept to explain, but her work has had a huge effect on our use of the worldwide web today. Her 
                  many inventions relate to how digital networks, or pathways, work to effectively transmit the information that 
                  we access through the internet.

                Feinler was an early pioneer in the creation of the internet. She was the director of the Network Information

                ARPANET. The ARPANET was an early version of what evolved into the internet. Lots of the domain names that we are 
                familiar with —.com, .gov, .org, .net, and .edu— come from the work of Feinler and her team.
