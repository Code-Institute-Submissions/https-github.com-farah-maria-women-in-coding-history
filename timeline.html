                    <img src="assets/images/eniac.jpg" alt="the ENIAC coders" class="center-img"><br><br>The coders for the pioneering ENIAC project in the USA were an all female team consisting of Kathleen MacNulty, Jean Jennings, Betty Snyder, Mary Wescoff, Frances Bilas and Ruth Lichterman. They established core software principles used today, such as using break points (- pausing a program at various points while it's running -) to help debug (or "fix") faulty computer programming. The modern computer as we know it had not yet been invented, so the ENIAC computer was an odd looking object. It was as big as a room, with wires and flashing buttons. However, it was able to direct a missile.

                  <p><img src ="assets/images/katherine_johnson.jpg" alt="photo of Katherine Johnson" class="float-left">Johnson was an Afro-American maths genius and "human computer" whose calculations put the first ever American astronaut in space. She worked for NASA and NACA (the organisation that was the predecessor for NASA) for 33 years and helped pioneer the use of machine computers to perform the task of calculating complex trajectories (flight paths) in space. She worked for NASA's Project Apollo and Project Mercury. For Project Mercury, she verified the first calculations of an actual electronic computer.

                  <p><br><img src ="assets/images/grace_hopper.jpg" alt="Grace Hopper with other computer scientists, black and white photo" class="float-right">Hopper worked on the world's first programmable computer, the Harvard Mark 1, and was the first to devise machine-independent programming. Previously, any given coding language only worked on one device... There was no language that could be used across different computing machines. So, Hopper made the first portable software coding language when she invented FLOW-MATIC, which evolved into COBOL, which is still used today.<p><br>Hopper also invented the first computer <strong>compiler</strong> as part of her work, which is a code translater that translates a programming language into machine code. Machine code is something that can be 'read' by a computer, and is always binary, which means it is made-up entirely of zeros and ones.  It is necessary to perform this step to make any coding program do-able, because computers only "understand" binary language. Everything we do on a computer is turned into binary for it to be processed, and then turned back into language we understand after the computer has done what we've asked. A short video about Hopper's life can be found <a href="https://youtube.be/Fg82iV-L8ZY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="click here for youtube video about Grace Hopper" class="history-link">here</a>.</p>

                  <p><br><img src ="assets/images/frances_allen.jpg" alt="photo of Frances Elizabeth Allen" class="float-left">So, now you know what a compiler is! Allen was a pioneer in optimising compilers. She made the long process of converting software programs into zeroes and ones a lot faster and easier. This work helped established the foundations of modern computing as we know it. She worked for IBM from 1957 to 2002 and was the first woman to win the Turing Award in 2006.</p>

                  <p><br><img src ="assets/images/valerie_thomas.jpg" alt="photo of Valerie Thomas" class="float-right">The code of Valerie Thomas allowed NASA to observe the Earth from space for the first time. Her Illusion Transmitter, patented in 1980, meant that images could be transmitted across long distances using dome-shaped mirrors. Thomas worked for the Landsat program and wrote the code that took in data from a Landsat CCT (computer compatible tape) and printed it out in a form that was easy for scientists to read. She learned and used the coding language FORTRAN for her work. Valerie Thomas is now a mentor for students through the organisation S.M.A.R.T and she works to encourage the participation of women of colour in science and tech.
